==Cuban=={Q241} Born American artist ==Felix Gonzalez Torres=={Q1288359} is known for his straightforward, ==minimalist=={Q173436} art that has depth to every piece. Many of the works include everyday objects such as candy, mirrors, stacks of paper and strings of light bulbs. His art invites the public into a new space where the viewer can interact with the art and at times take a piece of the instillation home. 
Gonzalez-Torres attended university in ==Puerto Rico=={Q1183} and later moved to ==New York city=={Q60} where he lived from 1967 to 1995 and created most of his artwork. Felix Gonzalez Torres passed away in 1996 while living in Miami, Florida. [^5]

From 1990-1993 Felix Gonzalez Torres made several [*instillations of candy.*](https://www.felixgonzalez-torresfoundation.org/works/c/candy-works) [*"Untitled" (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)*](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/152961/untitled-portrait-of-ross-in-l-a) is a unique work of art because it is an instillation piece and also considered a portrait. Gonzalez-Torres' named the piece after Ross Laycock who was his partner of 8 years.  Ross and Gonzalez-Torres both suffered from HIV and both passed away from ==AIDS=={Q12199} related illnesses. Ross died in 1991 at the age of 32 while Felix Gonzalez Torres passed away a few years later at the age of 39 in 1996. As the exhibit goes on the viewers take pieces of the candy, resulting in the same physical loss that Ross experienced in his life. This piece also speaks on the loss that Felix Gonzalez Torres experienced. [^2]

Felix Gonzalez Torres created a list of parameters for each candy exhibit that he created. In doing so he left many unanswered questions that created variables in each exhibit. In all there are 20 candy installations that were created, and any number can be on exhibit at any time. It's not uncommon for more than one to be on display at a time. It is up to the Exhibitor what candies are used, the shape of the candies are placed and if or how often the candies are replenished throughout the exhibit. 
The requirements are that there always is an "ideal weight" that the exhibit must start with and most correlate with the weight of one or two men. The medium is always an endless supply of wrapped candies. The dimension always varies for each instillation. [*"Untitled" (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)*](https://felixonline.co.uk/articles/felix-gonzalez-torres-conceptualising-the-hiv-epidemic/) is one of the most well known of the series, and one of his more personal pieces.

One of the most interesting aspect of this exhibit getting over the notion of being in an institution where you are traditionally not allowed to touch or get close to exhibits. Torres invites you to break these boundaries and invites you to interact and almost be a part of the installation. Not only are you allowed to touch the piece you can eat it or even take it home and frame it depending on which work you see of Gonzalez-Torres.  [^4]

Another impactful work by Felix Gonzalez Torres is "Untitled" (Perfect lovers.) Two clocks are hung side by side and start at the same time. As the instilation goes on, like many clocks they fall out of sync and will display different times. This is another representative of Ross and Gonzalez time together and the way that Ross has passed on and Gonzalez-Torres is still alive. The paramiters for this work is that both clocks must be standard, commercial clocks that are 13 1/2." Both clocks must be touching and start at the same time. An interesting conponent of this work is that if one clock stops they must be reset to start over. 

All of Torres' work is titled ==*"untitled"*==(Q97516281) with more details on the piece in the parenthesis next to it. This image is another example of one of his multiples that he did. On display now at the Milwaukee Art Museum is [*"Untitled" (Veterans Day Sale)*](https://collection.mam.org/details.php?id=1691). This piece is a stack of papers is titled Veterans day sale with the words printed on each paper.
