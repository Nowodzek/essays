From 1990-1993 Felix Gonzalez Torres made several instillations of candy. ["Unititled" (Portrait of Ross)](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/152961/untitled-portrait-of-ross-in-l-a) is one of those instillations where the weight of the candy is equal to the weight his parnter Ross when he was healthy. As the exhibit goes on the viewers take pieces of the candy, resulting in the same decrease that Ross experienced in his life.
