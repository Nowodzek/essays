.ve-header "Felix Gonzalez Torres' simplisity" cc:963be1d2-0045-4cff-bd20-8edb6b30dd84 
==Cuban=={Q241} Born American artist ==Felix Gonzalez Torres=={Q1288359} is known for his straightforward, ==minimalist=={Q173436} art that has depth to every piece. Many of the works include everyday objects such as candy, mirrors, stacks of paper and strings of light bulbs. His art invites the public into a new space where the viewer can interract with the art and at times take a piece of the instilation home. 
Gonzalez-Torres attended university in ==Puerto Rico=={Q1183} and later moved to ==New York city=={Q60} where he lived from 1967 to 1995 and created most of his artwork. Felix Gonzalez Torres passed away in 1996 while living in Miami, Florida. [^5]

From 1990-1993 Felix Gonzalez Torres made several [*instillations of candy.*](https://www.felixgonzalez-torresfoundation.org/works/c/candy-works) [*"Unititled" (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)*](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/152961/untitled-portrait-of-ross-in-l-a) is a unique instillation because it is an instillation piece and also considered a portrait. Gonzalez-Torres' named the piece after Ross Laycock who was his parter of 8 years.  Ross and Gonzalez-Torres both suffered from HIV and both passed away from ==AIDS.=={Q12199} As the exhibit goes on the viewers take pieces of the candy, resulting in the same physical loss that Ross experienced in his life. This piece also speaks on the loss that Felix Gonzalez torres experienced. [^2]

Felix Gonzalez Torres created a list of parameters for each exhibit that he created. In doing so he left many unanswered questions that created variables in each exhibit. In all there are 20 candy instillations that were created, and any number can be on exhibit at any time. It's not uncommon for more than one to be on dispaly at a time. It is up to the Exhibitor what candies are used, the shape of the candies are placed and if or how often the candies are replenished throughout the exhibit. [*"Untitled" (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)*](https://felixonline.co.uk/articles/felix-gonzalez-torres-conceptualising-the-hiv-epidemic/) is one of the most well known of the series, and one of his more personal pieces.

One of the most interesting boundaries of this exhibit is getting over the notion of being in an institution where you are not allowed to touch or get close to exhibits and now you have been invited to do just that. Not only are you allowed to touch the piece you can eat it or even take it home and frame it depending on which work you see of Gonzalez-Torres.  [^4]
