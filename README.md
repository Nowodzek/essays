 From 1990-1993 Felix Gonzalez Torres made several instillations of candy. "Unititled" (Portrait of Ross) is one of those instillations where the weight of the candy is equal to the weight of a man. As the exhibit goes on the viewers take pieces of the candy, resulting in the same decrease that Ross experienced in his life.
