From 1990-1993 Felix Gonzalez Torres made several instillations of candy. [*"Unititled" (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)*](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/152961/untitled-portrait-of-ross-in-l-a) is a unique instillation because it is considered a portrait. Ross was Gonzalez-Torres' partner Ross and Gonzalez-Torres suffered from HIV and both passed away from ==aids.=={Q12199} As the exhibit goes on the viewers take pieces of the candy, resulting in the same physical loss that Ross experienced in his life.

Felix Gonzalez Torres created a list of peramiters for each exhibit that he created. In doing so he left many unanswered questions that created viarables in each exhibit. In all there are 20 candy instillations that were created and any number can be on exhibit at any time. It's not uncommon for more than one to be on dispaly at a time. It is up to the Exhibitor what candies are used, the shape of the candies are placed and if or how often the candies are replenished throughout the exhibit.
